    <p>This is Roasted Duck, which is a must have at every Chinese dinner. Its delicious by giving you that sweet and salty flavor.</p>
    <p>You will need the follow <strong>ingredients</strong> to make this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Duck</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Dark Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Hoisin Sauce</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Star Anise</li>
        <li>Clove</li>
        <li>Five Spices</li>
    </ol>

    <p>First you will need to grind the garlic (2 cloves), ginger (3 slices), star anise (3 pcs), cloves (3 pcs), and five spices (1/8th tsp) together. Once grinded, mix the mixture in with soy sauce (1/2 cup), hoisin sauce (1/2 cup), dark soy sauce (2 tbs), and water (1 cup).</p>
    <p>Wash and clean your duck. Put the duck into the sauce mixture you've made. You should allow it to marinate overnight for best results.</p>
    <p>After letting it marinate overnight or however long, preheat over to 375 fahrenheit. Wrap Duck's wings with foil and roast duck in oven on a cake stand like mold or something similar to it.</p>
    <p>After an hour of letting the duck bake in the oven, take the foil away from the wings and change the oven to 425 fahrenheit. Bake foe 15-20 minutes or until the duck reaches a 165 internal temperature and is golden brown.</p>
    <p>Let it rest for at least 10 minutes and then enjoy to your liking!</p>

        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There's usually a sauce that you're supposed to eat with the Roasted Duck, but couldn't find it. However, I do think that the sauce is just the juices that is produced from baking the duck.</p>
