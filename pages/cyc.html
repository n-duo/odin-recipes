    <p>This is Chinese Yellow Chicken. This Chinese Yellow Chicken is one of my favorites because the chicken is tender and Delicious, especially when dipped in a flavorful <a href="./ggso.html">Green Ginger Scallion Oil</a> sauce.</p>
    <p>You will need the follow <strong>ingredients</strong> to make this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Whole Chicken (preferably a Free-Range one for best results)</li>
        <li>Pot big enough to fit your whole chicken</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Water (a lot of it)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first thing you will need to do is prepare your chicken by cleaning any bacteria. Make sure to not puncture the skin or else your chicken will become severly dry!</p>
    <p>Next, measure enough water that will submerege your whole chicken. After measuring just enough water, start boiling the water with some scallions and ginger. For us, around <strong>two scallions</strong> and <strong>five slices of ginger.</strong></p>
    <p>Once your water is boiling, slowly lower your chicken to the pot where the legs are down and the head is up. When water boils again, <strong>immediately</strong> take the chicken out of the pot and empty any water from its cavity.</p>
    <p>Start to boil your water again, but when it just starts to boil, turn the heat down to where the water is barely simmering. Place the chicken back in the pot. From this point after 30-50 minutes (depending on your chicken) it should be done!</p>
    <p>You can check whether its done by poking the chicken with a stick and the juices runs clear. When its done, lift the chicken out of the pot and place into a bowl of ice cold water.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE: SAVE THE BROTH!</strong> It has great flavor and can be used to make chicken noodle soup.</p>
    <p>Once the chicken becomes chilled, brush oil ontop and you're done. From this point you can slice to chicken into however you prefer. Enjoy with a fresh bowl of rice and green giner scallion sauce!</p>
