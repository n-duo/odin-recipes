    <p>This is BBQ Pork (Char Siu), which is a delicious sweet and savory prok dish. I find it very delicious and easily one my favorites.</p>
    <p>You will need the follow <strong>ingredients</strong> to make this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pork Shoulder</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Dark Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>White pepper</li>
        <li>Molasses</li>
        <li>Hoisin Sauce</li>
        <li>Hot Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Shaoxing rice wine</li>
        <li>Redfood coloring (optional)</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Five Spices</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Prepare the pork by cleaning it and cutting into thick slices. Mix the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, seasame oil, wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses, food coloring, and garlic together in a bowl.</p>
    <p>Reserve at least two tbs of the sauce on the side. Rub your pork in the saucew and let it reset overnight for best results.</p>
    <p>After letting it marinate, preheat your oven to 475 fahrenheit. Put the pork on a metal rack where heated water is able to lay below the pork (but not directly touching it). This will help prevent any burning or smoking. Put pork in oven once preheating is done. Check on the BBQ Pork (Char Siu) every 10 minutes. Adjust the temperature as needed.</p>
    <p>Roast for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, reduce temperature to 375 fahrenheit and let it continue to roat for 15 minutes. After letting it roast for 15 minutes, reduce temperature to 180 degrees and let it roast for another 15 minutes. Add water to the bottom of the pan if previous water has evaporated.</p>
    <p>With the sauce you've put to the side, add honey to the sauce and 1 tbs of hot water. Once roasting is done, baste pork with the sauce and let it roast for 10 minutes. After this, it should be done. It will look caramelized and delicious, however, if it's not caramelized to your liking, you can turn on the broiler and put the pork under it to futher caramelize it.</p>
    <p>To ensure your pork is cook use a meat thermometer and make sure the internal temperature has reached 160 fahrenheit. Following the directions correctly, it shoudl lead you to this delicious sweet ans savory pork. Cut to pieces and enjoy!</p>
