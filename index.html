    </h1>

        <p>In this project I will be talking about Chinese praying food and specifically <em><strong>my favorites</strong></em>.
        In my family, when we pray we are remebering out ancestors who have passed. We put different types of chinese cuisines and drinks out for them.
        The food would sometimes consists of duck, chinese chicken, different types of vegetables, pork, etc. The drinks would usually be wine or tea. Other people might also put beer or even soda.
        We pray and let our acestors eat.</p>
        
        <p>When our acnestors finish eating, which we know by the finish burning of the incense, we would them start preparing the food for my family to eat.
        I find this to be very similar to Day of the Dead (DÃ­a de los Muertos), as they both follow certain aspects that are very similar to each other.</p>

        <p>When I eat, you will always be seeing me eat and pick at these four foods:</p>
